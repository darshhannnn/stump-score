# StumpScore - Live Cricket Score Application

StumpScore is a modern web application that provides real-time cricket scores, match details, and statistics using React.js and Tailwind CSS. The application fetches live cricket data using a cricket API to display up-to-date information about ongoing matches.

## Features

- Real-time cricket scores and match updates
- Detailed match information including player statistics
- Live match status with run rates and required runs
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Beautiful UI built with Tailwind CSS
- Auto-refreshing data that updates every 30 seconds

## API Integration

StumpScore uses the Cricket API with the key `00ba4444-6577-435e-a241-02719e3c82e5` to fetch real-time cricket data. The API provides information about:

- Current matches
- Match details and scorecards
- Player information
- Team statistics

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
